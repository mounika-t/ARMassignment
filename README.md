1. Implement Fibonacci  series using Cortex M4
2. Given three number find the largest of the three using Cortex M4

3.  Given a number find out whether it is even or ODD in Cortex M4

4. Can we do nested IF-Then else in CORTEX –M4 ?
   We cannot do nested IF-Then else in CORTEX –M4.




6. Here is C program to find GCD of two numbers, Re-Write this for CORTEX –M4

while (a != b)

 {

    if (a > b)

            a = a – b;

       else

            b = b – a;

}
